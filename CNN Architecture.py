CNN Architecture


Theoretical Questions



1.	What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and why is it used for image processing?


A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network specifically designed for image processing. It's composed of multiple layers that extract features from images, making it highly effective for tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.


2.	What are the key components of a CNN architecture?

Key components of a CNN architecture include:
o	Convolutional Layer: Extracts features from the input image using filters.
o	Activation Function (ReLU): Introduces non-linearity to the network.
o	Pooling Layer: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
o	Fully Connected Layer: Classifies the extracted features.


3.	What is the role of the convolutional layer in CNNs?

The convolutional layer is the core component of a CNN. It applies filters to the input image, scanning it pixel by pixel to extract features like edges, corners, and textures.



4.	What is a filter (kernel) in CNNs?

A filter (kernel) is a small matrix of weights used in the convolutional layer. It slides over the input image, performing element-wise multiplication and summation to produce a feature map.


5.	What is pooling in CNNs, and why is it important?

Pooling is a technique used to reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps. It helps in reducing computational cost, preventing overfitting, and making the network more robust to small variations in the input image.


6.	What are the common types of pooling used in CNNs?

Common types of pooling include:
o	Max Pooling: Selects the maximum value from a region of the feature map.
o	Average Pooling: Calculates the average value from a region of the feature map.


7.	How does the backpropagation algorithm work in CNNs?

Backpropagation is the process of calculating gradients and updating weights in a CNN. It involves:
o	Forward pass: Calculate the output of the network for a given input.
o	Backward pass: Calculate the error at the output layer and propagate it back through the network to update weights.


8.	What is the role of activation functions in CNNs?

Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions used in CNNs include ReLU, Leaky ReLU, and Sigmoid.


9.	What is the concept of receptive fields in CNNs?

The receptive field of a neuron is the region of the input image that influences its output. In CNNs, the receptive field of a neuron in a higher layer is larger than that of a neuron in a lower layer, allowing the network to capture more complex features.


10.	Explain the concept of tensors in CNNs.

Tensors are multidimensional arrays used to represent data in CNNs. Images, filters, and feature maps are all represented as tensors.


11.	What is LeNet-5, and how does it contribute to the development of CNNs?

LeNet-5 was one of the earliest CNN architectures, developed by Yann LeCun in the 1990s. It was used for recognizing handwritten digits and paved the way for more complex CNN architectures.


12.	What is AlexNet, and why was it a breakthrough in deep learning?

AlexNet was a groundbreaking CNN architecture that won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge in 2012. It was deeper than previous CNNs and used techniques like dropout and ReLU to improve performance.


13.	What is VGGNet, and how does it differ from AlexNet?

VGGNet is a CNN architecture that uses a simpler design with multiple convolutional layers stacked on top of each other. It achieved state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks.


14.	What is GoogleNet, and what is its main innovation?

GoogleNet, also known as Inception, introduced the concept of Inception modules, which allow the network to learn features at multiple scales. This architecture was highly efficient and achieved state-of-the-art performance.


15.	What is ResNet, and what problem does it solve?

ResNet addresses the problem of vanishing gradients in deep networks by introducing residual connections. These connections allow information to flow directly from earlier layers to later layers, improving training and accuracy.


16.	What is DenseNet, and how does it differ from ResNet?

DenseNet is a CNN architecture that connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward manner. This dense connectivity allows for efficient feature propagation and improved performance.



17.	What are the main steps involved in training a CNN from scratch?
The main steps involved in training a CNN from scratch are:

•	Data Preparation: Collect and preprocess the image dataset.
•	Model Architecture: Design the CNN architecture, including the number and size of layers.
•	Model Compilation: Define the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
•	Model Training: Train the model on the training dataset using backpropagation.
•	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on a validation dataset.
•	Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the model on the test dataset or deploy it for real-world applications.
